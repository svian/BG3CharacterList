Her father, a dedicated druid, had little interested in Aesya and often left her in the care of others. Aesya has a love of music and often was found wherever singing and dancing was occuring. Aesya also developed skills as a hunter, and traded meat and furs to provide for herself. At the age of 23, Aesya left Mosstone for Esmeltaran, where she lived for over 2 decades.",
